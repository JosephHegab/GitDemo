<h3>git merge</h3>
<p>Combine two or more development histories together. Used in combination with fetch, this will combine the fetched history from a remote branch into the currently checked out local branch.</p>

<h3>git merge <branch-name></h3>
<p> Merge changes from one branch into the branch you currently have checked out.</p>

<h3>git merge --abort</h3>
<p>Aborts the merge process and restores the projectâ€™s state to before the merge was attempted. This works as a failsafe when a conflict occurs.</p>

<h3>git merge --continue</h3>
<p>Attempt to complete a merge that was stopped due to file conflicts after resolving the merge conflict.</p>

<h3>git merge --squash</h3>
<p>Combine all changes from the branch being merged into a single commit rather than preserving them as individual commits.</p>

<h3>git merge --no-commit</h3>
<p>Combine branch into the current branch, but do not make a new commit.</p>

<h3>git merge --no-ff</h3>
<p>Creates a merge commit instead of attempting a fast-forward.</p>
